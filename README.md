This is our Web API in ASP.NET written in C#. Our API makes calls to the SQL server and then can return data in JSON format to a GET call from our website. Calls range from getting teams, players, and leagues.

Microsoft Visual Studio created the majority of these files when we first created the project. We only editted a select few for our project, as most of the other files have to do with configuration of the API. The files we made changes to and/or added:
<ul>
<li>IntramuralsAPI/Controllers/LeagueController.cs</li>
<li>IntramuralsAPI/Controllers/TeamController.cs</li>
<li>IntramuralsAPI/Controllers/UserController.cs</li>
</ul>
